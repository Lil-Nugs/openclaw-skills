# AGENTS.md — OpenClaw Skills Repo Rules

This directory is a git-backed skills repository.

## If you edit anything under this folder

1. Check status: `git status`
2. Commit your changes with a clear message
3. Push to origin/main

## Required workflow

- Treat skill edits as versioned changes (no silent local-only edits).
- If push fails (auth/network/conflict), report it clearly in your reply.
- Prefer small, focused commits.

## Repo

- Remote: `git@github.com:Lil-Nugs/openclaw-skills.git`
- Branch: `main`

## Skill mutation guardrail

- Do not modify any skill files unless the user explicitly asks to regenerate/update a skill.
- For normal GameHub work, keep changes repo-local to the GameHub repo (games, games.json, scripts/docs).
